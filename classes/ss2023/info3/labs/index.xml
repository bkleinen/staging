This Startup Lab is about installing the tools you need for Python Programming and getting some (more) hands-on experience with git, so start with that. If bored, move on to try python.
Which Computer to use? In my experience, all Students prefer to use their own computers, which is possible as all Software we&amp;rsquo;ll use and need is free to use (at least for Students).</description></item><item><title>Exercise 02 - Learning Python</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/staging/classes/ss2023/info3/labs/lab-02-python/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/staging/classes/ss2023/info3/labs/lab-02-python/</guid><description>As always, you need to prepare a report together and each hand in this same report in moodle.
Part 1: Python Learning with Unit Tests Continue the collaborative work on the Python Learning Repository: https://github.com/htw-imi-info3/python-learning.
This part can be done together, but each person must have their own topic/file and each one must commit a new file to the repo and review two other files. However, you can (and should) help each other and discuss them in your group.</description></item></channel></rss>
